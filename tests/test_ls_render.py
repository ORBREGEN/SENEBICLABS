"""
Slice #3 (LIVE): the generated config for a project with a structured critical_miss field
is accepted by the running Label Studio and renders both controls; the verdict!=Correct
conditional is preserved on the tags LS stores. Talks to the live LS, cleans up after
itself. Run: PYTHONPATH=. python3 tests/test_ls_render.py

Boundary: this confirms LS *accepts and parses* the config and *preserves* the conditional
attributes it needs to show/hide correct_label + critical_miss. It does NOT drive a browser,
so the actual show-on-Incorrect interaction and a human annotation are not exercised here.
